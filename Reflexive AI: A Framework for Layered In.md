# Reflexive AI: A Framework for Layered Intelligence

This framework explores how to build AI systems that improve themselves through layered memory, reflection, and selective forgetting. Inspired by cognitive neuroscience and informed by practical constraints, it defines a structure where agents evaluate not just actions — but the quality of their own introspection.

---

## Architecture Overview

The system is structured in layers, each with a distinct cognitive role:

Level 2: Meta-Watcher

```ts
<pre>  System Hierarchy: Level 2: Meta-Watcher ↳ Reflects on the Watcher ↳ Edits Level 1 prompts, A/B strategies ↓ Level 1: Reflexive Watcher ↳ Evaluates Level 0 agents ↳ Edits prompts, tunes temp, A/B tests outputs ↓ Level 0: Execution Agents ┌──────────────┬─────────────┬─────────────┐ │ Orchestrator │ Strategist │ Tactician │ └──────────────┴─────────────┴─────────────┘ ↓ Shared Memory Layer (long-term) </pre>

```

## Layer Descriptions

### Level 0 – Execution Agents

| Agent        | Function                                                  | Memory Type                 | Temp |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-------|
| Orchestrator | Interprets user intent and delegates control              | Working + partial long-term | 0.3–0.5 |
| Strategist   | Generates context-aware insights and foresight            | Long-term declarative       | 0.7 |
| Tactician    | Performs precise, low-level actions                       | Procedural                  | 0.2 |

Each agent has its own local memory and receives prompt/parameter tuning from above.

### Level 1 – Reflexive Watcher

Monitors agent outputs in real time:

- Detects contradictions between agent outputs.
- Flags hallucinations, redundancy, or degraded performance.
- **Edits system prompts** for Level 0 agents.
- **A/B tests** new prompts, temperature ranges, or routing strategies.
- Tracks performance impacts of changes and rolls them back when needed.

Handles short-term forgetting:

```ts
// Short-term forgetting example
function forgetRecentNoise(memoryLog) {
  return memoryLog.filter(entry =>
    entry.importance > 0.5 &&
    entry.age < 7 &&
    !entry.redundant
  );
}

// A/B testing agent prompts
function testAgentPrompts(agentId, promptVariants) {
  return promptVariants.map((prompt, i) => ({
    agentId,
    variant: `v${i + 1}`,
    prompt,
    temperature: 0.4 + i * 0.1,
  }));
}
```

### Level 2 – Meta-Watcher

Reflects on the reflection process itself:

- Evaluates the Watcher's own logic and behavior over time.
- Modifies Watcher prompts, logic, or heuristics.
- A/B tests reflection strategies, such as shallow vs. deep analysis or different intervals.
- Handles strategic forgetting of outdated self-evaluation techniques.
- Runs on long intervals (e.g. milestone-based or weekly):

```ts

// Meta-watcher A/B testing reflection logic
const reflectionVariants = [
  { id: 'interval-3d', config: { intervalDays: 3, questionDepth: 1 } },
  { id: 'interval-7d-deep', config: { intervalDays: 7, questionDepth: 2 } }
];

// Strategic forgetting
function pruneReflectionHeuristics(history) {
  return history.filter(h =>
    h.lastUsedRecently && h.performanceImpact > 0.7
  );
}

```
Agent Temperature Strategy
Layer	Temperature	Purpose
Tactician	0.2	Deterministic execution
Orchestrator	0.4	Precise routing and delegation
Strategist	0.7	Insight generation, abstraction
Watcher	0.3	Low-variance analysis
Meta-Watcher	0.5	Balanced system improvement

Example Agent Call

```ts
const settings = {
  tactician: { temp: 0.2, prompt: "You strictly execute structured actions." },
  strategist: { temp: 0.7, prompt: "You generate high-level strategic insights..." },
};

const res = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: 'gpt-4o',
  temperature: settings[agentType].temp,
  messages: [
    { role: "system", content: settings[agentType].prompt },
    { role: "user", content: `${context}\n\n${command}` }
  ],
  response_format: { type: "json_object" }
});

```
Memory Stack
Memory Type	Used By	Purpose
Working Memory	All agents	Short-term context
Declarative	Strategist	Strategic planning, campaign data
Procedural	Tactician	Routine task execution
Reflection Logs	Watcher	Agent output histories
Heuristic Memory	Meta-Watcher	Reflection patterns, tuning strategies

When to Reflect
Trigger Type	Layer	Example
Contradiction	Watcher	Strategist suggests Gen Z, Orchestrator blocks it
Milestone Reached	Meta-Watcher	Campaign deployment completed
Performance Drop	Meta-Watcher	A/B test regression or plateau

Design Principles
Layered Reflexivity
Each layer reflects on the one below it, with bounded authority.

Bounded Feedback Loops
Avoid infinite regress by scheduling reflection at fixed intervals.

Prompt Adaptation
Prompts and temperatures are dynamic — updated via data and feedback, not hardcoded.

Selective Forgetting
Memory is constantly pruned for relevance at each level.

Neuro-Inspired Mapping

Procedural → Tactician (Cerebellum)

Declarative → Strategist (Hippocampus)

Metacognition → Watchers (Prefrontal Cortex)

Closing Note

This structure makes it possible for AI systems not just to reason, but to evaluate their own reasoning process, and update the tools with which they reflect. Every layer is editable. Every insight is testable based on user interactions.

In this framework, reflexivity isn’t recursion, it’s distributed governance. Intelligence emerges not from depth alone, but from how governance and responsibility is layered across different agents.
